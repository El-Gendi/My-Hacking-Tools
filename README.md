Welcome to my repository of novice hacking programs! This is a collection of scripts, tools, and experiments that I have created while learning and exploring the world of hacking, cybersecurity, and programming. These programs are intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and ethically.

This repository serves as a personal learning space where I experiment with coding, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity concepts.

I will drop here all the novice hacking tools that I create as  I  continue to learn the basics of cybersecurity and Threat Hunting. Most tools will be outdated, outright rudimentary, or maybe too simple or novice.

most programs are in Python for now, as I also continue 
to learn in parallel.

----------------
contents:
1- commandline MAC address changer 
2- Network Scanner for IP-Mac listing
3- ARP spoofing tool 
4- Packet-Sniffing tool (simple/unfinished)

to be added:
- portscanner, Vulnerability scanner and more.

----------------
requirements:
- a Linux environment; as these were coded in Nano and tailored for command-line interfaces.
- python 2+ modules (unless stated otherwise in the program code).
